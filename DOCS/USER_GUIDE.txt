STEEL HEAT TREATMENT / SURFACE PROCESS DECISION ENGINE
USER GUIDE
----------------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION

The Steel Heat Treatment / Surface Process Decision Engine is a Windows-based
application that helps users evaluate and compare heat treatment and surface
engineering processes for steel materials.

This guide explains how to install, launch, and use the application, as well as
how to extend it with custom material or process data.


2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox recommended)
- No Python installation required (bundled with installer)


3. INSTALLATION

1. Download the installer:
   SteelDecisionEngine_Setup_v1.0.0.exe

2. Double-click the installer file.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete installation.

4. After installation, shortcuts will be available:
   - Start Menu
   - Desktop (if selected during install)


4. LAUNCHING THE APPLICATION

1. Launch the application using:
   - Desktop shortcut, OR
   - Start Menu → Steel Heat Treatment Decision Engine

2. A launcher window will appear with the following options:
   - Launch UI
   - Stop UI
   - Exit

3. Click "Launch UI".

4. The application UI will open automatically in your default web browser.
   If the browser does not open immediately, wait a few seconds.


5. SINGLE MATERIAL EVALUATION MODE

This mode evaluates suitable processes for a single steel material.

Steps:
1. Select a material from the dropdown list.
2. Set priority sliders for desired properties:
   - Wear resistance
   - Fatigue life
   - Corrosion resistance
   - Strength
   - Toughness
   - Dimensional stability
3. Set process constraints:
   - Maximum process temperature
   - Distortion tolerance
4. Click "Run Decision Engine".

Results:
- Ranked list of feasible processes
- Explanation for each ranking
- Bar charts and radar charts for each process
- List of rejected processes with reasons


6. MATERIAL COMPARISON MODE

This mode compares process outcomes between two materials.

Steps:
1. Select Material A and Material B.
2. Choose whether to use the same priorities for both materials.
3. Set priorities and constraints.
4. Select comparison type:
   - Best vs Best
   - Manual Process Selection
5. Click "Run Comparison".

Results:
- Visual comparison charts showing performance differences between materials.


7. OUTPUT FILES AND SAVED RESULTS

The application automatically saves generated plots and comparison images
inside the installation directory.

Typical location:
C:\Program Files\SteelDecisionEngine\outputs\

These files can be reused for reports, presentations, or documentation.


8. ADDING CUSTOM MATERIALS OR PROCESSES (ADVANCED USERS)

The engine supports user-defined data through CSV files.

Location:
C:\Program Files\SteelDecisionEngine\data\user\

Files:
- user_materials.csv
- user_processes.csv

Instructions:
- Follow the column format strictly.
- Do not leave numeric fields empty.
- Use comma-separated values only.
- Refer to SAMPLE_DATA files provided in the repository for examples.

After editing CSV files:
1. Save the file.
2. Restart the application.
3. New entries will appear in the UI automatically.


9. STOPPING THE APPLICATION

To stop the application:
1. Return to the launcher window.
2. Click "Stop UI".

This safely terminates the running session.


10. COMMON USAGE TIPS

- Higher priority values increase influence in scoring.
- Constraint filtering occurs before scoring.
- Rejected processes are shown with explicit reasons.
- Visual charts help interpret trade-offs more effectively than scores alone.


11. LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMER

- The application provides decision support, not final prescriptions.
- Results depend on data quality and model assumptions.
- Always validate recommendations through engineering standards,
  simulations, or experiments before implementation.
