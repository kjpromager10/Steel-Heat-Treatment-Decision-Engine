STEEL HEAT TREATMENT / SURFACE PROCESS DECISION ENGINE
MODEL EXPLANATION AND ENGINEERING RATIONALE
----------------------------------------------------

1. PURPOSE OF THE MODEL

The Steel Heat Treatment / Surface Process Decision Engine is designed to assist
engineers in selecting appropriate heat treatment or surface modification
processes for steel components based on material properties, process constraints,
and performance priorities.

The tool is intended as an engineering decision-support system, not a replacement
for metallurgical expertise, standards, or experimental validation.

Its primary goals are:
- To reduce ambiguity during early-stage process selection
- To make trade-offs explicit and explainable
- To formalize engineering intuition into a structured evaluation framework


2. PROBLEM CONTEXT

In practical engineering environments, the selection of a heat treatment or
surface process is often driven by:
- Prior experience
- Rule-of-thumb knowledge
- Incomplete comparison across alternatives

This can lead to:
- Over-conservative process choices
- Ignoring viable surface engineering alternatives
- Difficulty explaining why one process was chosen over another

The decision engine addresses this by combining:
- Material compatibility rules
- Process constraints
- Multi-criteria performance evaluation
- Transparent explanation of outcomes


3. OVERALL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The decision engine follows a modular architecture consisting of:

- Data Layer:
  Material and process characteristics are stored in structured CSV datasets.

- Constraint Evaluation Layer:
  Determines which processes are physically and metallurgically feasible.

- Scoring Layer:
  Quantifies how well each feasible process satisfies user-defined priorities.

- Explanation Layer:
  Generates human-readable reasoning for rankings and trade-offs.

- Visualization Layer:
  Produces comparative charts to aid interpretation of results.

Each layer operates independently to maintain clarity and extensibility.


4. MATERIAL AND PROCESS REPRESENTATION

Materials are represented using:
- Material family (e.g., carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless steel)
- Carbon content
- Compatibility flags relevant to phase transformations

Processes are represented using:
- Process family (bulk heat treatment, surface treatment, coating, etc.)
- Required metallurgical mechanisms (martensitic transformation, diffusion,
  precipitation, etc.)
- Typical temperature ranges
- Expected benefits and trade-offs across performance properties

This representation allows new materials and processes to be added without
modifying the core engine logic.


5. CONSTRAINT-BASED FILTERING

Before any scoring is performed, the engine applies a series of constraints to
eliminate infeasible processes.

Typical constraints include:
- Incompatible phase transformation requirements
- Insufficient carbon content
- Excessive process temperature relative to user limits
- Distortion risk exceeding tolerance
- Known incompatibilities with specific material families

This stage ensures that physically impossible or unsafe processes are never
considered, regardless of scoring weights.


6. MULTI-CRITERIA SCORING LOGIC

After constraint filtering, remaining processes are evaluated using a weighted
multi-criteria scoring approach.

User-defined priorities are assigned to performance attributes such as:
- Wear resistance
- Fatigue life
- Strength
- Toughness
- Corrosion resistance
- Dimensional stability

Each process has predefined response coefficients indicating how it influences
each property. The overall score is computed as a weighted sum of contributions
and penalties.

This allows:
- Explicit trade-off evaluation
- Sensitivity to user intent
- Consistent ranking across alternatives


7. EXPLANATION AND TRANSPARENCY

A key design goal of the engine is explainability.

For each ranked process, the engine generates:
- Positive contributors explaining why the process scored well
- Identified trade-offs and penalties
- Reasons for rejection when a process is filtered out

This avoids the “black box” problem commonly seen in automated decision tools and
helps users build trust in the recommendations.


8. VISUAL COMPARISON AND INTERPRETATION

Graphical outputs are generated to support interpretation:
- Bar charts show individual property contributions
- Radar charts illustrate overall performance profiles

These visualizations help users quickly compare strengths and weaknesses across
processes without relying solely on numeric scores.


9. MATERIAL COMPARISON MODE

In addition to single-material evaluation, the engine supports comparison of
process outcomes across different materials.

This enables:
- Studying how material choice affects viable processing routes
- Comparing best-performing processes between materials
- Manual comparison of specific process-material combinations

All comparisons reuse previously computed results to ensure consistency and
avoid recomputation.


10. USER EXTENSIBILITY AND DATA CONTROL

The engine is intentionally data-driven.

Users may:
- Add custom materials
- Add custom processes
- Modify response coefficients

by editing user-specific CSV files without altering the core codebase.

This design supports educational use, research experimentation, and adaptation to
organization-specific process knowledge.


11. LIMITATIONS AND RESPONSIBLE USE

The decision engine is subject to the following limitations:
- Results depend on the quality and completeness of input data
- Simplified scoring models cannot capture all metallurgical interactions
- The tool does not replace standards, simulations, or physical testing

Users are expected to validate recommendations through appropriate engineering
methods before implementation.


12. ENGINEERING SIGNIFICANCE

This project demonstrates the application of:
- Systems thinking in materials engineering
- Formalization of domain knowledge into algorithms
- Explainable decision-support design
- Practical deployment of engineering software tools

It bridges theoretical metallurgical concepts with practical decision-making
needs commonly encountered in industrial environments.
