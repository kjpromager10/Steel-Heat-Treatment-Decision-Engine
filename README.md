# Steel Heat Treatment / Surface Process Decision Engine

A Windows-based engineering decision-support tool for selecting suitable **heat treatment and surface processes** based on material properties, constraints, and user priorities.

This tool is designed for **early-stage engineering decisions**, trade-off analysis, and comparative process evaluation — not for final certification or simulation.
