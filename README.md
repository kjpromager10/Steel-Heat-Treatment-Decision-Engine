# Steel Heat Treatment Decision Engine

A data-driven decision support tool for selecting steel heat treatment and surface engineering processes based on material properties, process constraints, and engineering priorities.

## Overview

This application assists engineers, students, and researchers in identifying suitable heat treatment or surface modification processes for steels by evaluating:

- Material compatibility
- Process constraints
- Performance priorities
- Trade-offs and limitations

The system is designed as an **engineering decision aid**, not a replacement for expert judgment.

## Key Features

- Single material process ranking
- Material-to-material process comparison
- Constraint-based filtering
- Weighted multi-property scoring
- Explainable recommendations
- User-extensible material and process databases
- Standalone Windows installer (no Python required)

## Installation

1. Download the installer from the `INSTALLER` folder
2. Run `SteelDecisionEngine_Setup_v1.0.0.exe`
3. Follow the on-screen instructions
4. Launch the application from the Start Menu or Desktop shortcut

## Basic Usage

- Launch the UI using the provided launcher
- Select material and define property priorities
- Review ranked processes and explanations
- View generated charts and comparisons

## User Data Extension

Users may add custom materials or processes by editing CSV files located inside the installed application directory:


Refer to `SAMPLE_DATA` for formatting examples.

## Disclaimer

This tool provides recommendations based on predefined models and datasets. Final engineering decisions should always be validated through experiments, standards, and expert review.
